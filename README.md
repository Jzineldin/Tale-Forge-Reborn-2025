### Environment Variables Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp tale-forge/.env.example tale-forge/.env
   ```

2. Fill in all the required environment variables in `tale-forge/.env`:
   - Supabase credentials
   - OpenAI API key
   - OVH AI API key
   - ElevenLabs API key
   - Stripe keys

### Installation
