● I see the issue! There's an authentication
  problem with the Edge Functions - they're
  expecting a supabaseKey but getting a different
  auth format. Let me fix this first, then handle
  the merge safely, and show you where to find the
   analytics.

  🔧 FIXING THE AUTH ISSUE FIRST

● The issue is clear - the Edge Functions are
  expecting a different auth format. Let me
  quickly fix this and then do the safe merge:


● Read(supabase\functions\create-story\shared\util
      s.ts)

  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● I see the issue! The Edge Function is expecting
  supabaseKey but the error shows it's looking for
   that specific parameter. Let me first commit
  our current state safely, then fix this auth
  issue:

● Perfect! Committed safely. Now let me do the
  merge to main:

● Now I can see the main branch has the old
  version! Perfect. Let me merge our enhanced
  branch:


● Bash(cd "E:\Tale-Forge-Reborn-2025" && git merge
       working-backup-20250823-011316)
