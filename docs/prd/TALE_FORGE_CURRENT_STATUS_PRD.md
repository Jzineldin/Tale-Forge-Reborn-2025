# Tale Forge - Current Implementation Status PRD
## Project Recovery & Completion Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** In Progress - 35% Complete  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Current Situation
Tale Forge is a partially implemented AI-powered storytelling platform with excellent documentation but significant implementation gaps. The project has a solid foundation (80% complete) but lacks critical backend integration and core functionality.

### 1.2 Critical Issues
- **No Real Backend Integration**: All data is mocked, no API connections
- **Missing Environment Setup**: No API keys or service configurations
- **Incomplete Authentication**: Using localStorage mock instead of Supabase Auth
- **Non-functional Core Features**: Story generation, user management, billing not working

## 3. Critical Path to MVP

### 3.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Make the app functional with real services

1. **Environment Configuration** (Priority: Critical)
   - Create `.env` file with all API keys
   - Configure Supabase project connection
   - Set up AI service credentials (OpenAI, OVH AI, ElevenLabs)
   - Configure Stripe for payments

2. **Real Authentication System** (Priority: Critical)
   - Replace mock AuthContext with Supabase Auth
   - Implement email/password authentication
   - Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Fix user session management and persistence

3. **Database Schema Setup** (Priority: Critical)
   - Implement Supabase database schema
   - Create tables: users, stories, story_segments, subscriptions
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Test database connections

### 3.2 Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
**Goal**: Make story creation and reading work

1. **Story Generation Pipeline** (Priority: Critical)
   - Connect frontend to generate-story-segment edge function
   - Implement real AI story generation with OpenAI
   - Add image generation with OVH AI
   - Test end-to-end story creation flow

2. **Story Persistence** (Priority: High)
   - Implement story saving to database
   - Add story library functionality
   - Create story retrieval and display
   - Add progress tracking

### 3.3 Phase 3: User Experience (Week 3)
**Goal**: Complete user-facing features

1. **Complete Story Creation Wizard** (Priority: High)
   - Finish all 5 steps with real data flow
   - Implement character management
   - Add genre selection with proper templates
   - Test full creation workflow

2. **Story Reading Experience** (Priority: High)
   - Complete story reader with real data
   - Implement choice system with persistence
   - Add audio playback functionality
   - Create sharing and export features

## 4. Technical Debt & Blockers

### 4.1 Immediate Blockers
1. **No Environment Variables**: Cannot connect to any external services
2. **Mock Authentication**: Users cannot actually sign up or persist data
3. **No Database Queries**: All data is hardcoded or mocked
4. **Missing API Integration**: Core AI features non-functional

### 4.2 Technical Debt
1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: No standardized error management
2. **Missing Loading States**: Poor UX during async operations
3. **No Testing**: Zero test coverage for critical functionality
4. **Performance Issues**: No optimization for production

---

## 5. Success Criteria

### 5.1 MVP Definition
- [ ] Users can sign up and authenticate with real accounts
- [ ] Users can create stories that persist to database
- [ ] AI generates real story content with images
- [ ] Users can read and interact with stories
- [ ] Basic subscription and billing works
- [ ] Admin can manage users and content

### 5.2 Quality Gates
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Real authentication working
- [ ] Database integration complete
- [ ] Story generation pipeline functional
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Basic testing coverage (>50%)

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### 6.1 High-Risk Areas
1. **AI Service Integration**: Complex API interactions, rate limits
2. **Authentication Flow**: Security critical, user experience impact
3. **Database Performance**: Story data can be large, needs optimization
4. **Payment Integration**: Financial transactions, compliance requirements

### 6.2 Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Build and test one feature at a time
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services fail
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all critical paths before deployment
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear setup and troubleshooting guides
