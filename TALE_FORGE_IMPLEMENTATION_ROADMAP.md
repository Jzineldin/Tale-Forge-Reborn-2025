# Tale Forge Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a structured implementation plan for rebuilding Tale Forge based on the TALE_FORGE_PRD_2025.md, OPTIMIZED_ROUTING_SKELETON.md, and README_FOR_REBUILD.md documents. The plan aligns with the 6-week rebuild timeline while incorporating the homepage implementation with main-astronaut image, icon usage strategy, and prioritizing critical path items.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- Basic frontend structure with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Routing structure (needs optimization)
