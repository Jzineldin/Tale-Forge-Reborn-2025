The portal shimmered with rainbow colors, and mysterious whispers could be heard from the other side. As ${childName || 'they'} approached, the portal began to glow brighter, revealing glimpses of an enchanted realm filled with floating islands and gentle dragons.`,

Tiny fairy lights danced around glowing crystals, and in the center stood a wise old wizard with a long silver beard. "Welcome, ${childName || 'young one'}," he said warmly. "I have been waiting for someone brave enough to help save our magical kingdom."`

With excitement building, ${childName || 'our hero'} decided to follow the mysterious trail marked on the weathered parchment.`,

On the other side, they could see the entrance to a cave marked with ancient symbols. The bridge looked sturdy enough, but the water below was deep and fast-moving. ${childName || 'They'} had to make an important decision about how to proceed.`

Through the window, they could see books floating through the air by themselves! ${childName || 'They'} knew this was definitely not normal and decided to investigate this peculiar mystery.`,
        
        `Creeping closer to the library window, ${childName || 'the young sleuth'} saw a small, friendly-looking creature with pointy ears organizing the floating books. The creature appeared to be a library fairy, working hard to sort through hundreds of stories. When it noticed ${childName || 'them'} watching, it waved cheerfully and gestured toward the front door, as if inviting them inside.`

A friendly alien with big, kind eyes emerged and introduced itself as Zorp from the planet Zigzag. "Greetings, Earth friend," Zorp said in a musical voice. "We need your help to find our lost cosmic pet, Sparkle, who loves to hide among the stars."`,
        
        `${childName || 'The space explorer'} climbed aboard Zorp's amazing spacecraft, which was filled with blinking lights and floating buttons. Through the transparent dome, they could see Earth getting smaller as they zoomed toward a nearby asteroid field where Sparkle was last seen. Zorp handed ${childName || 'them'} a special helmet that would help them breathe in space and communicate with cosmic creatures.`

      bedtime: [
        `As the sun set and painted the sky in soft purples and golds, ${childName || 'a sleepy child'} was getting ready for bed when they heard a gentle tapping at their window. Outside sat a wise old owl wearing tiny spectacles, holding a glowing book in its wings. "Hello there," hooted the owl softly. "I'm Luna, the Dream Keeper, and I have wonderful bedtime stories to share with you."`,
        
        `Luna the owl invited ${childName || 'the child'} on a peaceful journey through the Cloud Kingdom, where everything was soft and silvery. They floated gently on a cloud-boat, watching sleepy star-children dance in the moonlight while gentle lullabies drifted through the air. The Cloud Kingdom was a place where all worries melted away and dreams came to life in the most beautiful ways.`
